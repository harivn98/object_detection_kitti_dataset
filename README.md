# Advanced Multi-Modal Object Detection System for Autonomous Driving
Advanced Multi-Modal Object Detection System for Autonomous Driving
End-to-End SLAM+ADAS Pipeline with YOLOv8 Implementation
Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive computer vision system for autonomous driving applications, implementing a complete data pipeline for processing multi-modal sensor data (camera, LiDAR, IMU, GPS) and training state-of-the-art object detection models on industry-standard datasets including KITTI, PKLot, and Waymo.

🏗️ Technical Architecture & Design Decisions
1. Data Pipeline Architecture
Technical Implementation:

Built a unified data loading system using Python dataclasses and enums for type safety
Implemented modular loader classes with inheritance patterns for extensibility
Created standardized data containers (SensorFrame, CameraData, LiDARData) for multi-modal fusion

Technical Reasoning:

Modularity: Separate loaders for each dataset (KITTI, PKLot, Waymo) allow independent development and testing
Type Safety: Used Python dataclasses with type hints to prevent runtime errors and improve code maintainability
Scalability: Unified interface allows easy addition of new datasets without modifying existing code
Memory Efficiency: Lazy loading approach only loads data when requested, crucial for large autonomous driving datasets

2. KITTI Dataset Processing Pipeline
Technical Implementation:
python# Calibration matrix processing for camera-LiDAR fusion
calib_data['P2'] = calib_data['P2'].reshape(3, 4)  # Camera projection matrix
calib_data['Tr_velo_to_cam'] = calib_data['Tr_velo_to_cam'].reshape(3, 4)  # LiDAR-to-camera transform
Technical Reasoning:

Multi-Modal Fusion: KITTI provides calibrated camera and LiDAR data, essential for 3D object detection
Binary Point Cloud Handling: Implemented efficient reading of .bin files using NumPy's fromfile() for high-performance LiDAR processing
3D to 2D Projection: Processed calibration matrices for projecting 3D LiDAR points to 2D camera coordinates
Label Format Standardization: Converted KITTI's 15-parameter 3D bounding box format to standardized internal representation

3. Data Preprocessing & Augmentation Strategy
Technical Implementation:

Implemented YOLO format conversion with normalized coordinates [0,1]
Applied train/validation split (90/10) with stratification
Configured data augmentation: mixup (0.1), copy-paste (0.1), mosaic (1.0), geometric transforms

Technical Reasoning:

Normalization: YOLO requires normalized coordinates for scale-invariant training across different image resolutions
Data Split Strategy: 90/10 split maximizes training data while providing sufficient validation samples (typical for large datasets like KITTI's 7,481 samples)
Augmentation Balance: Conservative augmentation values prevent overfitting while maintaining realistic image distributions critical for autonomous driving safety

4. YOLOv8 Model Selection & Optimization
Technical Implementation:

Selected YOLOv8-nano for optimal speed/accuracy trade-off
Implemented dynamic batch size based on GPU memory (4-32 depending on available VRAM)
Used AdamW optimizer with cosine learning rate scheduling

Technical Reasoning:

Model Choice: YOLOv8n provides 80+ FPS inference speed crucial for real-time autonomous driving applications
Memory Management: Dynamic batch sizing prevents OOM errors across different hardware configurations
Optimizer Selection: AdamW with cosine scheduling provides better convergence than SGD for transformer-based architectures in YOLO
Transfer Learning: Pre-trained COCO weights accelerate convergence and improve small object detection

5. Hardware-Adaptive Training Configuration
Technical Implementation:
pythonif gpu_memory >= 16:  # High-end GPU
    config['batch'] = 32
    config['lr0'] = 0.01
elif gpu_memory >= 8:  # Mid-range GPU
    config['batch'] = 16
    config['lr0'] = 0.01
Technical Reasoning:

Resource Optimization: Adaptive configuration maximizes hardware utilization without causing memory overflow
Learning Rate Scaling: Smaller batch sizes require lower learning rates to maintain training stability
Production Deployment: Configuration supports both high-end training GPUs and edge deployment scenarios

6. Advanced Performance Monitoring & Evaluation
Technical Implementation:

Implemented comprehensive metrics tracking (mAP50, mAP50-95, per-class performance)
Created ground truth vs prediction visualization pipeline
Built automated model export for multiple deployment formats (ONNX, TorchScript)

Technical Reasoning:

Industry Standards: mAP metrics align with autonomous driving industry benchmarks
Visual Debugging: GT vs prediction comparison helps identify systematic errors (false positives/negatives)
Deployment Flexibility: Multiple export formats support different inference engines (ONNX Runtime, TensorRT, mobile deployment)
