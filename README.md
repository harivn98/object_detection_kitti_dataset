### **2. Feature Extraction Process**

**Multi-Scale Feature Extraction:**
- **Layer 1-3**: Low-level features (edges, textures) at high resolution

### **3. Object Detection Process**

**Anchor-Free Detection:**

- **Direct Coordinate Regression**: Predicts (x_center, y_center, width, height) directly
- **Multi-Scale Prediction**: Three different scales (8√ó, 16√ó, 32√ó downsampling) for different object sizes

**Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):**
- **IoU Threshold**: 0.5 (removes overlapping detections of same object)
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.25 (filters low-confidence predictions)
- **Class-Agnostic NMS**: Considers all classes simultaneously for suppression
